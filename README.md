# Extension Scaffold (ES)

ES is designed to be a lightweight alternative to OWF.
The extension design concept comes from opensource
tools such as Eclipse, VSCode, and Theia.
However, code from the above projects was not directly
utilized in an attempt to make a small and understandable implementation.
