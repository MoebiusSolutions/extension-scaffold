# Example Snowpack Extension

> âœ¨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).

This application is designed to load extensions.
The extensions is where the primary functionality should be hosted.
This application allows extensions to register panels that
are wrapped in a shadow DOM so that each extension does not
have to worry about the CSS of other extensions interacting
with its components.
